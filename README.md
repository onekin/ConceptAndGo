Concept&Go is a web annotation tool aimed at concept mapping. A concept map is a diagram or graphical tool that visually represents relationships between concepts and ideas. Its simplicity is both its strength and weakness. Their graphical appeal makes concept maps very popular among academics and practitioners alike to account for the early stages of domain analysis. Indeed, concept mapping can be a powerful tool in the world of education, helping students to perform at higher cognitive levels and helping teachers to explain complicated subjects and assess student understanding. Likewise, Concept mapping is a group process, making it an ideal activity for teams or groups of stakeholders, and it is especially when solving problems, whether they be in marketing, new product design, or administration. These diagrams are excellent storytellers, helping in the ideation and inspiration phases. When it comes time for implementation, concept maps help with instruction, documentation, and communication. 

Smooth communication between supervisor and student is a critical concern in higher education. Ineffective communication can lead to the supervisor being unaware of the amount and type of feedback that the student requires or it can cause ambiguity about the next step, leading to PhD delays, and ultimately student frustration. Different strategies for supervising have been proposed. Specifically, one example is resorting to structured meetings where the student’s knowledge is analyzed against what the student needs to learn. This means that supervisors are more like guides who help students become active learners by building on what they already know. This constructivist approach to learning highlights the active role played by learners in constructing and developing knowledge and extracting meanings from their prior knowledge and experiences.

From this perspective, concept mapping goes beyond concept maps to integrate 'reading' and 'discussing'. Despite this obvious fact, most support for concept mapping stops at diagramming concept maps, leaving learners unassisted when it comes to tracking the readings and discussions behind. For generating concept maps, a variety of software exists, e.g. Inspiration, Hozo, CmapTools, Protégé, or Sero. Utilizing such software provides significant support in creating, manipulating, storing, and reusing concept maps. Yet, in ill-structured, wicked problems where a formal representation does not exist yet, the confidence on a concept map is that of the process that generates it. One of the main premises of this work is that in ill-structured domains, the confidence of concept maps can be leveraged by tracing concepts back to the readings/discussions that ground these concepts. Readings and discussions often leave traces in terms of annotations. Annotating includes highlighting text, adding comments, or classifying the annotated readings. Different studies consider annotation to be a common practice among both academics and practitioners. Here annotations help to bridge the gap between the documentation realm and the conceptual realm.

# User manual

Concept mapping is a tool that has been shown to improve student learning quality. In a doctoral setting, we can not pretend that supervisors are knowledgeable enough to assess the convenience of concepts and relationships found in the student’s concept map right away. Unlike other educational scenarios, the added value of the instructor is not so much in providing a competent external perspective about the goodness of the concept map as it is in providing methodological support about the research schedule, monitoring the progress of the project, finding a balance between problem and solution concerns, and the like.
This scaffolding role of the supervisor represents a major departure from other educational scenarios. In secondary education, the instructor knows ‘the right answer’, and hence, the instructor is able to identify shortcomings in the concept map with only the help of the concept map itself. By contrast, a doctoral setting is one where supervisors do not often know ‘the right answer’, and their guidance is mainly about the journey (i.e., concept mapping) rather than the destiny (i.e., the concept map). Meta-concepts helped students deal with cognitive overload by increasing the focus through meta-concepts. In addition, supervisors can now see at a glance how well the question narrative is covered. Meetings can be organized to address each of the meta-concepts, quickly identifying gaps in the narrative.

Concept&Go is a web annotation tool aimed at concept mapping. A concept map is a diagram or graphical tool that visually represents relationships between concepts and ideas. When the reading material (PDF or Web content) is opened in a browser tab,  Concept&Go can be activated with a single click. This causes a sidebar to show up on the left part of the document. This sidebar contains the concepts collected so far. Compared with other Web tools (e.g., Diigo), Concept&Go does not stop at highlighting quotes from text paragraphs but elaborates on the so-gathered quotes to come up with concepts and relationships. From this perspective, Concept&Go is not stand-alone but requires two companions: Hypothes.is as the annotations’ persistent storage, and CmapCloud (the cloud service of CmapTools) to depict the developed concept map with its annotations.

# Setting up Concept&Go

**Access to local files**

Once you have installed Concept&Go, you will find the web extension icon in the right part at the top of the toolbar. We recommend pining it in the toolbar to facilitate the use of the tool.

![Screenshot 2022-09-05 at 16 23 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31988855/188472900-ce49ec6a-9687-4224-93cd-94a633733d92.png)

The next step is to prepare the setup to prepare the application before using it. First, in the “Manage extension” menu you have to activate the permission to allow access to local files.

![Screenshot 2022-09-05 at 16 23 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31988855/188472979-eeff314f-08b7-41d0-b324-2ff833eec036.png)

In order to do that, you have to activate the “Allow access to file URLs” option.

**Hypothes.is and Cmap cloud user configuration.**

The next step is to configure your Hypothes.is and CmapCloud accounts to be able to annotate and export your concepts and relationships. In this case, you have to open the “Options” menu.

![Screenshot 2022-09-05 at 16 23 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31988855/188473270-efd374ab-345b-4c0e-a802-309f199753e5.png)

In the following page, first, you have to Log in to your Hypothes.is account and authorize access to it. Then, in the next box, you have to provide the credentials to set up your Cmap Cloud account and click the “Validate account” button.

![Screenshot 2022-09-05 at 16 23 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31988855/188473290-e703f51b-b3c3-408d-ad1b-162c9f217c8d.png)

Once both configurations have been properly set up, the page will show you that you are logged in to both services.

You can change your credentials whenever you like in the same menu by clicking the “Log out” and “Change user credentials” options.

Once completed the setup, you are ready to enjoy Concept&Go. See the user manual to learn how to use it.

# Requirements
In order to use Concept&Go you will need the following requirements. First of all, Concept&Go by itself does not support all the functionality required. It works together with two other applications for completing the whole concept map assessment.

On the one hand, Hypothes.is is used as persistent storage to allow users to save and retrieve created annotations when necessary. It is a widely-used annotation server that requires users to have an account in Hypothes.is to be able to store annotations there. If you are not registered in Hypothes.is, you will need to create an account at the following link: https://web.hypothes.is/

On the other hand, if Concept&Go also uses CmapCloud (the cloud service of CmapTools) to depict the concepts and relationships gathered during the map construction to visualize them as a concept map with the annotations that support the trace of the map element. In this case you will need a CmapCloud account that can be created in the following link: https://cmapcloud.ihmc.us/login.html

# How to use it

**Create the concept map and set the focus question**

The map construction starts with the supervisor creating a cmap in CmapCloud and defining the focus question that has to be addressed by the students with the provision of a set of meta-concepts that will guide the student during concept mapping. When it comes to concept mapping, the focus question is meant to provide ‘a clearly defined goal for reading’ . However, our experience is that this falls short. As an example, consider the question ‘To what extent is student-supervisor communication problematic in DSR doctoral studies?’. Our experience is that this question may still be too open, risking cognitive overload. To fight this back, supervisors can set up a list of ‘meta-concepts’ that help structure the answer to the focus question. Back to our sample question, this question’s narrative can be articulated through meta-concepts such as ‘cause’, ‘consequence, or ‘evidence’, and in doing so, it guides the gathering of new concepts. On these premises, the form for the focus question in CmapTool’s is being reinterpreted. Specifically, Concept&Go resorts to the keyword entry to hold the meta-concepts (see the following figure).

![Screenshot 2022-09-05 at 16 43 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31988855/212865685-76e506ca-a55a-431f-b8f5-2f015d1d09ad.png)

Then, the student can start the activity by (1) exporting the supervisor provided Cmap and (2) importing it in Concept&Go:

![Screenshot 2022-09-05 at 16 43 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31988855/212875800-12c50719-2b1b-4595-ae00-8d690f71e091.png)

From the specified keywords, Concept&Go generates a dedicated color-coded highlighter. In the highlighter, color coding is used to denote meta-concepts (3). In the highlight object, a property keeps the associated meta-concept.

**Identify concepts**

Now, the student locates excerpts that sustain these concepts. The student can highlight text from the reading visor that displays the research article and create concepts based on the meta-concepts. By underlining a text excerpt and clicking one of the meta-concepts buttons a new window is opened to create a new concept. The figure shows the case for Background assessment:

**Create relationships**

The next step is to create the relationships between concepts. Relationships are made up of two concepts that are linked by a linking word. As well as with concepts, users can find concept-link-concept triples propositions in reading materials. These relationships can be found written explicitly, implicitly or in a table form. Therefore, the user has to be able to capture the relationship by annotating the linking word in the same way as with concepts. To complete a relationship it is necessary to provide the "from" and "to" concepts together with the lin

**Export to Cmap Cloud**

After some reading, the student returns to CmapTools. On loading the Cmap, Concept&Go retrieves codes, relation annotations, and highlights that are turned into concepts, relationships, and resources, respectively. During the supervisory meeting, this concept map can be changed;

After capturing the map elements that are relevant for the student, the student has to export the annotated content as a concept map to review the result. Concept&Go provides the option to export a concept map and the created annotations to a CmapCloud account. For that, the student has to provide his/her CmapCloud user credentials to associate the tool with the CmapCloud account. Once the association is done, students are able to export the concept map. You can export the concept map by two ways. If you click the first option of the toolset, you can download all the files of the concept map and upload them then manually to your CmapTools. Instead, if you select the second button all the files (except the one on the map (.cxl)) are exported automatically to the Cmap Cloud account. The cxl file is downloaded in the browser and has to be uploaded manually in the corresponding folder of Cmap Cloud. For both options, you have the chance to export the concept map with the Concept&Go generated URL or with the Hypothes.is generated ones.

![Screenshot 2022-09-05 at 16 45 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31988855/188475123-99977e99-0147-4217-96b9-36f022cd4645.png)

The concept map is exported in a folder that is automatically generated in the CmapCloud home folder with the name of the concept map and its version. The folder contains the file that represents the concept map and the web annotation resources (URLs) that are referenced within the concept map.

Concept&Go  turns the CmapTools canvas into an index of the student's bibliography. This use of concept maps as navigational tools to existing material is reported in the literature. Click on a resource to go back to the reading material, specifically, at the point where the excerpt is placed. Notice 'Lack of tools' at the bottom of the highlighter.

**Go back to the annotation space**
 
By supporting annotations as URLs rather than mere text, it is possible to navigate back to the reading material.  The next figure shows the case for ‘organisms’. Concepts are now displayed together with their annotation counterparts. Click on the annotation icon (), for opening the annotations in subsequent browser tabs  (see Fig. 2.3). Students can then go back to the reading sources where the annotation appears, check back their annotations, update as appropriate, and when convenient, move back to see the whole picture again in CmapCloud.
